    <center><h3>Stock Markets, Tails and Black Swans </h3></center>
    <p>Stock markets behave weird. They fascinate enthusiasts from different disciplines producing a standard literature on how stock markets behave. This is the literature that produced a lot of Nobel prizes in economics.
    It's the description of stock markets in terms of the bell curve and its twins, namely variance, standard deviation and so on.</p>
    <p>A criticism of this approach has been pointed out by Nassim Taleb, a trader coming from the pits of Wall Street: The actual occurrence of massive jumps in stock markets is
    much higher than predicted by Bell curve-base approaches.</p>Taleb argues from the point of view of an experienced stock trader who knows <i>from his gut</i> that following standard terminology leads to Nobel prizes
	    but financial losses in the real world of stock markets. The action on Wall Street is in the rare events, corresponding to the tails of centered probability distributions. The Bell curve predicts a very
	    small number of rare events, not in line with what can be observed on the stock market
    <p>Famously sitting in an attic in New York, Taleb condensed his knowledge into bestseller books (<i>Fooled by Randomness</i>, <i>Black Swan</i>, ...).</center>>

    <center><h3>It was Mandelbrot all along</h3></center>
    <p>It seems to me that Taleb shows an affection for the <i>Godfather</i>  movies in his books. At one time or another, he might have thought to himself: <i>It was Mandelbrot all along.</i> The father of fractals who spent much of 
    the second half of the 20th century, developed a theory on fractals and applied it to the real world, sometimes to the stock market. Mandelbrot certainly wrote about randomness and distinguishes different kinds of randomness. There is a kind
    of randomness that predict more events in the tails. </p>
    <p>Take a look at the plot below. It shows a stock market model based on <i>multifractal cartoons</i>, a simple algorithm by Mandelbrot to construct stock markets with fractal behaviour.</center>
